          <h2>The Mission</h2>
          <p>
            At CTU-Buddy, our mission is to empower students at City Technical
            University with an intuitive and interactive platform designed to
            enhance their academic experience. We believe that by providing a
            central hub where students can manage their schedules, engage in
            discussions, and share resources, we can foster a collaborative and
            supportive learning environment that drives academic success.
            <br /><br />
            Our goal is to create a seamless, user-centric experience that
            adapts to the evolving needs of students, helping them stay
            organized, informed, and engaged throughout their academic journey.

          <h2>The Vision</h2>
          <p>
            Our vision is to create a cutting-edge educational system that
            becomes an essential tool for every CTU student. We aim to transform
            the way students interact with their academic community, providing
            seamless access to the resources and tools they need to thrive in
            their studies. <br /><br />
            By integrating innovative technologies and a forward-thinking
            approach, we aspire to set new standards for digital learning
            platforms, making CTU-Buddy a model for other institutions.
            Ultimately, we envision CTU-Buddy as a platform that not only
            enhances the academic experience but also inspires continuous
            growth, and innovation in education.

      <h2>The Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of CTU-Buddy is to support students in their academic
        journey by offering a user-friendly platform that brings together
        essential academic features in one place. Whether itâ€™s organizing
        timetables, participating in discussions, or accessing shared resources,
        CTU-Buddy is here to help students succeed and connect with their peers
        and educators. Our goal is to simplify and streamline daily academic
        tasks, allowing students to focus more on learning and less on
        logistics. <br /><br />
        Beyond just a tool for individual success, CTU-Buddy aims to cultivate a
        sense of community and belonging within CTU. By facilitating easy
        communication and resource-sharing, we hope to bridge the gap between
        students, faculty, and staff, promoting collaboration, mentorship, and a
        stronger academic network. With security, accessibility, and ease-of-use
        as core pillars, CTU-Buddy strives to be a trusted companion that
        enhances both the academic and social aspects of university life,
        contributing to a more holistic educational experience for all students.
